Answer: In this scenario, the two contradictory parameters from the 39 parameters in the context of TRIZ methodology are:
1. Parameter #12: Shape - The drug delivery system needs to be designed in a way that it can target a specific part of the body, which requires a particular shape. However, this shape might not be the most suitable for manufacturing or ease of repair, which are other important parameters to consider.
2. Parameter #36: Device complexity - A targeted drug delivery system is likely to be more complex than a systemic administration method. This complexity can increase the cost and difficulty of manufacturing, operation, and repair. However, the benefit of targeted delivery is that it reduces side effects in other parts of the body.
To solve this contradiction, the TRIZ methodology can help by identifying the ideal final result (IFR) and applying the inventive principles to find a solution that satisfies both contradictory parameters. For example, one possible solution could be to develop a modular drug delivery system that can be easily adapted to different shapes and sizes, reducing the complexity and increasing the ease of manufacture and repair.
